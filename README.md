# Credit Card Financial Dashboard Using Power BI
  This project demonstrates how to build a Credit Card Financial Dashboard using Power BI, connecting directly to a SQL database for real-time data analysis. The dashboard provides advanced financial insights, allowing 
  businesses to monitor credit card usage, transactions, and financial trends.

# Power BI Project Overview
  This Power BI project connects to an SQL database to visualize credit card transaction data in an interactive, professional dashboard. By integrating financial data, we gain valuable insights into transaction patterns, 
  customer behavior, and overall financial performance.

# Key Features
  
  ● Connect Power BI with SQL Database: The dashboard is powered by a direct connection to an SQL database, ensuring real-time data updates for accurate analysis.
  
  ● Import Data in Power BI: Data is imported seamlessly from the SQL database, processed, and transformed within Power BI.
  
  ● Power Query in Power BI: Using Power Query, data is cleaned, transformed, and merged, allowing for accurate representation in charts and tables.
  
  ● DAX in Power BI: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) are used to create custom measures and perform complex calculations, such as total transaction amounts and average customer balances.
  
  ● Create Charts and Tables in Power BI: Various charts and tables, including line graphs, bar charts, and summary tables, are built to represent key financial metrics.
  
  ● Power BI Dashboard Design: The dashboard is designed with a focus on professional presentation, including clear, user-friendly layouts and visual hierarchies to display critical financial insights.

# Insights from the Dashboard
